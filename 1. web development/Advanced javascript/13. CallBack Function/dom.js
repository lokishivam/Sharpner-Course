window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  console.log("DOM has loaded");
});

// The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the HTML content of a page has been completely loaded and parsed,
// without waiting for images and other external resources to finish loading.
//  This means that the callback function will be executed as soon as the DOM is ready and can be manipulated by JavaScript.
